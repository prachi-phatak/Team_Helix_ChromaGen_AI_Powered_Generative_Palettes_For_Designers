# Team_Helix_ChromaGen_AI_Powered_Generative_Palettes_For_Designers
"ChromaGen," a generative AI-powered tool designed to streamline and  inspire the color palette creation process. The platform's objective is to translate  complex, natural language prompts and inspirational images into complete,  ready-to-use design palettes.

Key Features:
1)  Multi-Modal Prompting: Users can generate palettes by providing a text
    description (e.g., "An energetic palette for a fitness brand inspired by a
    tropical sunset") or by uploading an image to extract its core color scheme.
2)  Generative Color Engine: A core AI model, likely a fine-tuned diffusion model
    or a GAN, that understands the context of prompts to generate a harmonious
    set of 5-7 colors.
3)  Structured Palette Output: The generated palette is clearly organized into
    primary, secondary, and accent colors, with their corresponding HEX, RGB,
    and HSL codes available for easy copying.
4)  Automated Accessibility Auditing: The tool automatically checks the
    generated palette for key accessibility metrics, specifically WCAG contrast
    ratios (AA and AAA levels) between text and background colors, and
    provides a color-blindness simulation view.
